                    Pet accessories are essential items that enhance the comfort, safety, and overall well-being of pets while making pet ownership more convenient and enjoyable. 
                    Collars and leashes are vital for ensuring pets’ safety during outdoor activities, while harnesses provide a more secure and comfortable option for walks. 
                    Grooming tools such as brushes and nail clippers keep pets clean and healthy, reducing the risk of infections. 
                    Toys, from chewables to interactive puzzles, stimulate pets’ minds and help them stay physically active. 
                    Feeding accessories like automatic feeders and water fountains make mealtime easier and ensure pets stay hydrated. Additionally, accessories like pet beds, carriers, and clothing provide warmth, comfort, and style, catering to the unique needs of pets and their owners.
